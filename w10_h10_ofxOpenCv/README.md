For this project, I want to continue to work on Hole detection cam. I thought I could add some interesting effects on it; basically I was imaging that once I open my mouth, and a large number of ball or circles will come out from my mouth. Hence, I add particle system and gravity so that it can generate lots of circles and their motion can be controlled. 
But Iâ€™m having some trouble with adjusting the size of screen (width, height and size of Contourfinder), when I was trying to make screen bigger on my laptop but then it turns out that there is no any effects showing up (just normal camera).
