For this project, I want to continue to work on Hole detection cam. I thought I could add some interesting effects on it; basically I was imaging that once I open my mouth, and a large number of ball or circles will come out from my mouth. Hence, I add particle system and gravity so that it can generate lots of circles and their motion can be controlled.
