For this assignment, basically I just add gravity to the particle system by keep pressing keyboard “A” and “D” to control the direction. I really have alot fun to play around with the code we've learned from last class, but honestly I still have a hard time to digest everything. So I think I really should start to learn c++ basics before I want to create some mind-blowing works.
