http://codepen.io/heiwad/pen/AXgjYK 
Basically,what i want to do for this project is trying to get API(data) from Giphy. Once typing anything you want in the search box, the funny Gifs will automatically pop up and will not disappear unless you click "Restart" button. 

Week4 - the project learned from "Button Examples" on Arduino Website. 
  
  Video about my Arduino project - https://vimeo.com/user57175098/videos 
  Basically, When you press the button, the LED's will light conseculatively one by one with minor delays in between. Once you press button again, the LED's will go out.
