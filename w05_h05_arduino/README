Video about my work: https://vimeo.com/185384606 

Start by connecting 5v to the photocell sensor, because the sensor is not polarized, so it does not matter how I connect it. Then conncet the output of the sensor to the analog input A0 of the Arduino board. And last, adding a resitstor into this circuit. In order to use a photocell to control a basic LED light, I add another circuit which include a LED and a resistor. Then, the brightness of LED will be changed along with how much light the photocell can sense of. Like in a dark environment, the photocell will have a fairly high resistance, so the LED light will be dimmed gradually.
